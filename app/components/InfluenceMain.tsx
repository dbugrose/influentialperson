 The natural elements in Oliver’s poetry, love interwoven throughout all her works, and her gentle, devoted tones have allowed her works to resonate with a vast audience, earning her the title of best-selling poet in 2007. And while her works may have earned her worldwide acclaim, her poems also hold immense personal significance to me. During times of darkness, they prompt me to find beauty in the little things. When all feels lost, they serve as reminders that joy exists wherever you choose to see it. Mary Oliver's reverence for life carries me through the hardest moments, urging me to recall that "It is a serious thing/just to be alive/on this fresh morning/in this broken world". Though she is no longer with us, Mary Oliver is immortalized by her poetry and the meaning it carries for her readers - myself included.
