Over the course of her career, Oliver wrote 55 collections of poetry and nonfiction prose and amassed 12 literary awards, including the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award. Her work focuses on nature and her reverence for the world around us. Oliver expertly conveys the delight she finds within the simplicity of the mundane.</p>
<p><br></br>
 Her deep appreciation for nature seen throughout her work was inspired by her forest exploration during her childhood in Maple Heights, Ohio. These adventures in wilderness, in conjunction with a traumatic family life, prompted her to develop a rich and beautiful inner world as a form of escapism. She began translating these inner experiences into written word at the tender age of 14, and she continued to do so up until her death in 2019.
